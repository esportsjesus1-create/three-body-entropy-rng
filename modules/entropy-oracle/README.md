# Entropy Oracle Module

Generates provably fair randomness using three-body physics simulation.

## Overview
This module implements the core entropy generation system based on three-body gravitational dynamics.

## Features
- Three-body physics engine
- Cryptographic commitment scheme
- Deterministic chaos-based entropy
- Verifiable randomness generation

## API
- `generateEntropy()`: Generate entropy from current three-body state
- `commitToSeed()`: Create cryptographic commitment
- `revealSeed()`: Reveal committed seed for verification
